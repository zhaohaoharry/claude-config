# Classic AER Exemplars

A reference table of canonical *American Economic Review* (and adjacent
top-5) papers mapped to the AER-skills they best exemplify. Use these
papers as **architecture templates** — not as content to imitate.

> **See also:** [`modern-aer-exemplars.md`](modern-aer-exemplars.md) for a
> subfield-organized list of recent (2018-2025) papers that demonstrate
> *current* estimator practice — Callaway-Sant'Anna staggered DiD,
> Borusyak-Hull-Jaravel shift-share, Calonico-Cattaneo RDD, Anderson-
> Rubin weak-IV inference, and AEA-compliant openICPSR deposits.
> The two files are complementary: this one for **architecture**
> reference, the modern file for **estimator** reference.

All openICPSR / Dataverse links below resolve to publicly available
replication packages. They are the gold standard for what an AER deposit
should look like in 2026.

### Regression Discontinuity

| Paper | Year | Outlet | Why it's the exemplar | Deposit |
|---|---|---|---|---|

| Carrell, Sacerdote & West, "From Natural Variation to Optimal Policy?" | 2013 | Econometrica | RDD with a behavioral-mechanism twist; read for *negative* heterogeneity that forced the authors to update their structural prior. | journal site |

### Synthetic Control

| Paper | Year | Outlet | Why it's the exemplar | Deposit |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Abadie, Diamond & Hainmueller, "Comparative Politics and the Synthetic Control Method" | 2015 | AJPS | The methodological reference. Read alongside Abadie's 2021 JEL survey for the modern toolkit. | journal site |

Cited as a model AEA RCT Registry entry. | [AEA RCT Registry](https://www.socialscienceregistry.org/) |
| Karlan & List, "Does Price Matter in Charitable Giving?" | 2007 | AER | Compact RCT design; read for power-calculation reporting. | journal site |

## What to Extract from Each Exemplar

When studying a classic, build a **3-bullet architecture note**:

1. **Identification one-liner.** "Causal variation comes from [...]; the
   exclusion restriction is [...]; defended by [...]."
2. **First-paragraph hook anatomy.** What number does the first paragraph
   anchor on? What stylized fact? What policy stake?
3. **Robustness battery.** Which 3-5 placebos / alternative samples /
   alternative estimators carry the most weight in the appendix?

Most AER-quality papers can be reverse-outlined into these three notes in
under 30 minutes. Do this for the three exemplars most relevant to your
own design before drafting your own introduction.

## Important Caveat

Several exemplars above predate the modern (post-2020) econometric
defaults. The Card-Krueger 1994 DiD is canonical *as a narrative
architecture*, but a 2026 staggered DiD using the same TWFE specification
would be flagged. Read these papers for **structure**, not for **estimator
choice**. For estimator choice, follow `aer-identification`.
